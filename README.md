# Tears of Themis - Card Sequence Arranger
Method Credits: [@dodogitu](https://www.hoyolab.com/article/31954175)

## Why?
A website to help you rearrange the order of cards **for the first 15 turns** based on what you need.
- We cannot determine the order of cards after you reload the card deck. 

## TODOs
### Criticial
- [ ] Write instructions on how to use the website + Change naming

### Quality of Life
- [ ] Mobile-friendly layout

### Future Features
- [ ] Keeps track of the main skill for each card for easier planning
- [ ] Auto-load initial card grid from screenshots (Potential Challenges: Needs to handle different card looks)
- [ ] Auto-load Enemy Waves (Potential Challenges: Needs to safely handle pulling data from tot.wiki or save the data locally)
